High-Level Takeaways

"Key Insights from Behavioral Data"

Customer Segments:

Using Travel Tide's historical booking and session data, i identified Six key customer groups.

Booking Behavior:

Each segment has unique travel patterns, such as frequency of travel, trip cancellation rates, average spending on bookings etc.

Reward Perks:

Tailored perks were created for each segment to drive engagement and foster long-term relationships with customers.


**"Customer Segmentation Based on

Travel Preferences"**

Family-Oriented Travelers:

Characterized by longer stays and multiple rooms. Often book trips for family vacations.

Assigned Perk:

Assigned Perk:

Free Checked Bag** (catering to family needs).

High-Spending Travelers Tend to spend significantly on both flights and hotels.

Assigned Perk: Free Hotel Meal (adding value to their luxury experience).

Budget Travelers: Actively look for discounts and prefer affordable bookings.

Assigned Perk: Exclusive Discounts (appealing to their cost-conscious nature).

Frequent Travelers: Travel frequently with a low trip cancellation rate.

Assigned Perk: 1 Night Free Hotel with Flight (rewarding loyalty and encouraging repeat bookings).

Spontaneous Travelers: Make bookings close to the departure date, with low cancellations.

Assigned Perk: No Cancellation Fees (encouraging risk-free bookings for last-minute planners).

Moderate Travelers: Moderate Travelers typically book more than three trips annually.

These travelers often balance personal and work trips and are likely to seek convenience during their journeys.

Assigned Perk:

This perk is especially appealing to those who seek comfort and time-saving advantages without needing luxury benefits.
